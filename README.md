# `corpcrap`

Just prints out something that sounds fancy, but is total bullshit.


##### Examples

```
Interactively cloudify resource-leveling mindshare
Proactively utilize efficient convergence
Rapidiously transform resource-sucking clouds
```


#### Installation

Just pull the binary you need from the releases page and put it in one of the dirs in `$PATH`.

*OR*

Do a go install after cloning.


#### Why

I used to use `fortune` to display something when I start a shell.
Just to replace that. This is a bit more funny and _useless_.
